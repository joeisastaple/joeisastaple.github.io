	<h1>Resume</h1>
	<p>Iâ€™ve delivered results both in-house and freelance; whether it's concepting and creating digital campaigns for optometrists that led to a significant increase in eyeglass sales, breaking down 5G technology for the everyday consumer, and working with national STEM education companies to help them find their voice across online platforms. <br>
This has led me to have successful partnerships with brands local, regional, and national, telling stories in a way that captivates and converts an audience. <br>
<a href="https://medium.com/@joeisastaple">And of course, I write for myself, too.</a> <br>
What stories can we tell together?</p>
