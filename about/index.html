	<h1>Howdy, there</h1>
	<p>I’m Joe. But you know that already. I’m a copywriter, and content creator that spends far too much time on the internet. I write and report on the <a href="https://medium.com/clift-co/5g-you-a-simple-explanation-for-a-complex-technology-2d10b1d276b6">current state of tech</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@joeisastaple/return-of-the-rpg-96571cd502b2">video games</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/staples-sound-off/the-perfect-morning-how-i-turned-my-apartment-into-a-jetsons-esque-utopia-7f251943d9a7">smart home technology</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@joeisastaple/starwarsszn-7e0e4e8a1c63">Star Wars</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@joeisastaple/heavy-little-bastards-ac60e7234919">my love of books</a>, and even my <a href="https://medium.com/@joeisastaple/for-sale-cursed-jeep-f59d0d988427">damn cursed jeep</a>. I’ve been featured on Medium.com a few different times for the above. <br>
I’m a proud Brooklyn cat dad to two constantly hangry cats, and currently passionate about how technology can make us more human. <br>
When I’m not typing furiously on my keyboard, or discussing internet culture + baseball with my girlfriend (we’re two giant nerds that love our ballpark hotdogs), I can be found geeking out on the Switch or binge-watching <a href="https://juicyecumenism.com/wp-content/uploads/image01-3.jpg">Ancient Aliens</a> (hey, don’t judge). <br>
I operate with a Kansas City kindness, wild Nevadan way of thinking, and a  New York work ethic.</p>
